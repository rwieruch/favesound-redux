## Contribute

Feel free to contribute to that project! I would love to see a GitHub issue where you want to work on! Moreover I will try to find the time to raise some issues myself where people can contribute. At the end it is a perfect project to get started in open source!

## Future

I want to provide an amazing experience for artists to find new music with the help of their own profile and surroundings like followers, followings etc. This is just the beginning :)
